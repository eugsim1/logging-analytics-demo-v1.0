At this stage you should start the workshop by uploading log files to your Logging Analytics Partition.

To start the configuration of your Logging  Analytics Workshop click on the Cloud shell image of the oci console :

 

![](images/oci_loggin11.jpg)



When the cloud shell is ready you will get this section on the bottom of your screen :


![](images/oci_loggin12.jpg)




Click on maximize to open a wider terminal


![](images/oci_loggin13.jpg)


in the cloud shell execute the command:

`git clone https://github.com/eugsim1/logging-analytics-demo-v1.0.git`

![](images/oci_loggin14.jpg)


A directory is created as logging-analytics-demo-v1.0 , execute the below command from your shell :

`cd logging-analytics-demo-v1.0/logging-analytics-demo/`

Execute the following command : ./setup.sh "your_workshop_account",  in our case the command is :

`./setup.sh analytics000`

Be very careful to enter exactly your account as the first argument of the ./setup.sh command.

the setup script is performing a series of initial verifications, then uploads to your account ( in our case analytics000) several logs , creates a log group, and several entities.

Wait until the completion of the script.

`Running demo setup script: Jan-28-2021`
`get the compartment id for the compartment LoggingAnalytics`
`Checking to see if compartment analytics000 under LoggingAnalytics  already exists`
`Compartment  analytics000 Already exists`
`Compartment analytics000 OCID=ocid1.compartment.oc1..aaaaaaaahd45l6jvxsnw5xvnfybs75aqujhmw4ygqjwnawuiay7wo2xjjbba`
`Checking to see if group Logging-Analytics-SuperAdmins already exists`
  `Already exists`

`Checking to see if log group LoggingAnalytics-LogGroup-analytics000 already exists`
`log group LoggingAnalytics-LogGroup-analytics000 Does not exist yet, create log group`
`Log Group LoggingAnalytics-LogGroup-analytics000 OCID=ocid1.loganalyticsloggroup.oc1.eu-frankfurt-1.amaaaaaaufnzx7iafzno3jejwrgnuwggq6kyxi6zxfdpvxx3tw523auwzo7q`
`from update_timestamps=>Dont Create log directories`
`from update_timestamps=>Dont change Log Record timestamps`
`Compressing files`
```Uploading Logs for user analytics000`
  `Created Entity db1-analytics000 ...`

`Created Entity dbhost1.oracle.com-analytics000 ....`

  ``Created Entity bigip-ltm-dmz1.oracle.com-analytics000` 

  ``Created Entity ...`

  ``Created Entity apigw1.oracle.com-analytics000 ..``



At this stage your Logging Analytics compartment is loaded with data, minimize the cloud shell.
Then refresh the Administration view of the Logging-Analytics

Remember ALWAYS to choose on the Compartment drop-down list your own compartment (analytics000 is our case)
then you should see the following configuration :

![](images/oci_loggin15.jpg)


On the Administration left entry list click on the entities and you will see that several entities are configured according to annotation entity-user_acount as  (in our case entity-analytics000):

![](images/oci_loggin16.jpg)

A log group is associated for your account with the annotation LoggingAnalytics-LogGroup-analytics000

From this point on you should follow the steps depicted on the tutorial :

https://docs.oracle.com/en/learn/oci_logging_analytics_tutorial_sample_logs/#introduction



On the next version of this Workshop you will install a management Agent on a Linux Host, and you will activate VCN flow logs to a oracle oci bucket, then with the oci cli API you will upload them to Logging Analytics

This tutorial will be regularly updated
